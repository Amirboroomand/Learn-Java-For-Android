However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc). Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java code is always written in the form of classes and objects. Android heavily relies on the Java programming language all the SDKs required to build for android applications use the standard libraries of Java.
